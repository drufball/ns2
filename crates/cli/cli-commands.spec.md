# CLI Commands Spec

## Overview

All commands follow a `ns2 <noun> <verb>` structure. Running `ns2` with no arguments attaches to the orchestrator session.

---

## `ns2 session`

### `ns2 session list`

List all sessions. Output columns: `id`, `name`, `agent type`, `status`, `last activity`.

Default: last 24h, up to 10 sessions. Sort order: `failed` → `waiting` → `running` → `completed` → `cancelled`, then by last update within each group.

Flags (all optional):
- `--status <status>` — filter by status (`running`, `waiting`, `completed`, `failed`, `cancelled`)
- `--agent <type>` — filter by agent type
- `--since <duration>` — filter to sessions active within a duration (default: `24h`). Format: `XXd:YYh:ZZm` with any field optional (e.g. `1d`, `2h:30m`, `1d:12h`).
- `--limit <n>` — max sessions to return (default: 10)

### `ns2 session new`

Create a new agent session. Prints the session ID on success.

Flags:
- `--name <name>` — human-readable label for the session
- `--agent <type>` — agent type; defaults to `coding`
- `--message <message>` — opening message to kick off the session. If omitted, session is created in `waiting` state.

### `ns2 session attach`

Attach the TUI to a session. Defaults to the orchestrator session if no flags provided.

Flags:
- `--id <id>` — attach by session ID
- `--name <name>` — attach by session name

### `ns2 session tail`

Print the most recent content blocks from a session to stdout without attaching the TUI. Useful for the orchestrator agent to check on sessions programmatically.

Flags:
- `--id <id>` — identify by session ID
- `--name <name>` — identify by session name
- `--turns <n>` — number of recent turns to show (default: 5)

### `ns2 session stop`

Cancel a running or waiting session.

Flags:
- `--id <id>` — identify by session ID
- `--name <name>` — identify by session name

### `ns2 session send`

Queue a message to a session without attaching.

Flags:
- `--id <id>` — identify by session ID
- `--name <name>` — identify by session name
- `--message <message>` — message to queue

---

## `ns2 agent`

### `ns2 agent list`

List all available agent types from `.ns2/agents/`, showing name and description from frontmatter. No flags.

### `ns2 agent new`

Create a new agent system prompt file in `.ns2/agents/` and open it in `$EDITOR`.

Flags:
- `--name <name>` — agent type name (becomes the filename and frontmatter `name`)
- `--description <description>` — short description written into frontmatter
- `--body <body>` — initial system prompt body; if omitted, file opens empty in `$EDITOR`

### `ns2 agent edit`

Updates the provided fields. All flags optional — if none provided, errors.

Flags:
- `--name <name>` — agent type to edit
- `--description <description>` — update the frontmatter description
- `--body <body>` — replace the prompt body directly.

---

## `ns2 spec`

Spec files (`.spec.md`) are design documents that declare which source files they govern. A spec file has YAML frontmatter with the following fields:

- `targets` — a list of glob patterns (relative to the git root) for files this spec covers
- `verified` — an ISO 8601 UTC timestamp recording when the spec was last confirmed to match its targets
- `severity` — optional, `error` (default) or `warning`. Warning specs print a notice when stale but do not cause `sync` to exit non-zero (unless `--error-on-warnings` is passed).

Files without valid frontmatter (e.g. the raw architecture or harness spec files) are silently ignored by all `ns2 spec` commands.

### `ns2 spec new`

Create a new spec file at the given path with the provided targets. The file is initialized with a `targets` list and no `verified` timestamp (unverified). The body is left empty.

Args:
- `<path>` — path where the spec file should be created (e.g. `crates/myfeature/design.spec.md`)

Flags:
- `--target <glob>` — glob pattern for files this spec covers; can be repeated
- `--severity <error|warning>` — severity level for stale detection (default: `error`)

Prints `Created spec at <path>` on success. Errors if the file already exists.

### `ns2 spec sync`

Check whether any files matched by spec targets have been modified since the spec was last verified. Compares each target file's modification time against the `verified` timestamp. If `verified` is absent, every matched file is considered stale.

If any stale files are found, prints an error listing each affected spec path and its offending files, then exits non-zero. If all specs are clean, exits 0 with no output.

Args (optional):
- `<path>` — path to a specific `.spec.md` file; if omitted, checks all `.spec.md` files found recursively from the git root

Flags (all optional):
- `--error-on-warnings` — treat `warning`-severity specs as errors; exits non-zero if any spec (regardless of severity) has stale files. Intended for CI.

Spec files without valid frontmatter (missing `targets`) are silently skipped.

### `ns2 spec verify`

Mark a spec as verified at the current time, writing the current UTC timestamp into the `verified` frontmatter field. The rest of the file (body and targets) is preserved.

Args:
- `<path>` — path to the spec file to verify (required — cannot verify all specs at once)

Prints `Verified <path>` on success.

---

## `ns2 workspace`

### `ns2 workspace list`

List all worktrees, showing branch, path, and the status of the current session on that branch.

Flags:
- `--status <status>` — filter by current session status (`running`, `waiting`, `completed`, `failed`, `cancelled`)

### `ns2 workspace clean`

Delete a worktree manually, typically after the branch has been merged.

Flags:
- `--branch <branch>` — branch whose worktree to remove
- `--force` — remove even if the branch hasn't been merged
